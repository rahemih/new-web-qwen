EQCOFE — Equipment Coffee

EQCOFE is an Iranian e-commerce platform for coffee equipment, built as a SQL-first modular monolith with PostgreSQL, explicit transaction boundaries, transactional outbox delivery, worker/scheduler processes, and an OpenAPI-first HTTP contract.
Canonical status

    Latest verified full runtime regression: 586/586 PASS
    Latest verified OpenAPI: 531 paths / 601 operations / 1179 refs — PASS
    Latest verified architecture gate: 467 files — PASS
    Fresh isolated PostgreSQL migration verification: 65/65 migrations PASS; checksums MATCH
    Step-53 experience contract: 7 actors / 24 journeys / 153 OpenAPI operation references — PASS
    Step-54 foundation contract: 35 primitive colors / 19 semantic roles / 13 type styles / 13 component families / 12 accessibility requirements — PASS
    Step-54 free repository library: 34 metric tokens / 3 deterministic artifacts / drift check — PASS

    Import provenance matters: the historical GitHub repository was a partial traceability/recovery mirror. The runnable source in this import comes from the final Step-44 canonical artifact, not from pretending the old GitHub main tree was complete.

Provenance and historical accuracy

No fake historical Git commits are manufactured in this repository. Earlier decisions/steps are documented from recoverable artifacts, code, tests, Git evidence, Google Drive and project context. Anything not sufficiently recoverable is explicitly marked UNVERIFIED or PARTIAL.
